# biblias_ASP
This is my original Bible project (simultaneous text-lookup in three Spanish Bibles) in ASP

Prominent features of the app:
1. It uses an Access database containing three Spanish Bible versions
2. It makes (probably overabundant) use of server-side include files to hold functions
3. Looking at it now, it has include files that pull even more include files, which probably is not smart
